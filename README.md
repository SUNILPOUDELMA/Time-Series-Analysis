Time Series Analysis of auto insurance in the United States
Designing efficient and robust algorithms for accurate prediction of auto insurance market prices is one of the most exciting challenges in the field of time series analysis and forecasting. With the exponential rate of development and evolution of sophisticated algorithms and with the availability of fast computing platforms, it has now become possible to effectively and efficiently extract, store, process and analyze high volume of auto insurance market data with diversity in its contents. Availability of complex algorithms which can execute very fast on parallel architecture over the cloud has made it possible to achieve higher accuracy in forecasting results while reducing the time required for computation. For this project I will be using the time series data of the auto insurance sector of US for the period January 2010 till January 2020 that are publicly accessible. First demonstrate a decomposition approach of the time series and then illustrate how the decomposition results provide us with useful insights into the behavior and properties exhibited by the time series. Further, based on the structural analysis of the time series, I propose six different methods of forecasting for predicting the time series index of the auto insurance sector. Extensive results are provided on the performance of the forecasting methods to demonstrate their effectiveness.
